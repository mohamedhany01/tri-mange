## Installation & Usage

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: The application is cross-platform, meaning it works for **web**, **Android**, and **iOS**. However, most development and testing have been focused on **Android**, so the web and iOS versions may not be fully optimized or thoroughly tested.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The project is expected to work on **GNU/Linux** without issues. However, it has not been tested on **Windows** or **macOS**.

---

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) ‚Äì [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
  Alternatively, use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to manage different Node.js versions on your machine.

- **Android Studio** for mobile development ‚Äì [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)  
  - **Android Studio Emulator** for running Expo projects ‚Äì [Setup Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)

- **Git** ‚Äì [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open a terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamedhany01/tri-mange.git
   cd tri-mange
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required packages using `npm`:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**  

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your Firebase project settings. You can find these settings in the [Firebase Console](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592).

    Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

    ```env
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id

    # Proxy endpoint
    EXPO_PUBLIC_PROXY_ENDPOINT=endpoint-link
    ```

    ---

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**  

    Firebase is a serverless platform, and according to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys#general-info), it is safe to embed the following keys directly in your app:

    - **API Key**  
    - **Auth Domain**  
    - **Storage Bucket**  
    - **Messaging Sender ID**  
    - **App ID**  
    - **Measurement ID**  

    Instead of securing these keys, Firebase Security Rules should be used to control access to your backend. For more details on implementing Firebase Security Rules, refer to the [Firebase Security Rules Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules).

    üîß **Optional: Reverse Proxy Configuration**

    To enhance security further, you can use a **Reverse Proxy** to handle requests and obscure your Firebase keys.

    1. **Enable the Reverse Proxy** by setting the `EXPO_PUBLIC_PROXY_ENDPOINT` in your `.env` file and hardcoding the endpoint in the `fetchFirebaseAppKeys` function.

    2. **Modify the following files** if you want to disable or customize the Reverse Proxy feature:

    - **`utilities/apis/index.tsx`**  
    - **`firebase/configuration.ts`**

    If you decide to set up a standalone Reverse Proxy, initialize `EXPO_PUBLIC_PROXY_ENDPOINT` with your endpoint URL in the `.env` file.

4. **Supported NPM Scripts**

    The project includes several useful scripts to manage development, testing, and deployment. Below is a list of available scripts along with their descriptions.

    | **Script**                  | **Description**                                                                                                         |

    | **`reset-project`**         | Runs a custom script to reset the project (useful for cleaning and resetting local changes).                           |
    | **`android`**               | Runs the app on an Android emulator or physical device in development mode with debugging enabled.                     |
    | **`android:release`**       | Builds and runs a release variant of the Android app. Logs can be viewed using `start:native:logging`.                 |
    | **`ios`**                   | Runs the app on an iOS simulator or physical device.                                                                   |
    | **`web`**                   | Starts the Expo development server for the web platform.                                                               |
    | **`test`**                  | Runs all Jest tests in watch mode for continuous feedback during development.                                          |

    | **`lint:fix`**              | Automatically fixes linting issues where possible.                                                                     |
    | **`start:native:logging`**  | Displays native Android logs in real-time, useful for debugging native code and issues.                                |
